\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my promoter, Martijn. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to study in the Netherlands and to work with you in the connectome lab. The last four years are the most precious and memorable period in my life. I really appreciate everything you taught me and all the supports and encouragements you gave me, as well as the countless markups you made in all of my manuscripts, posters, and slides. With your help, I've grown up into a person with more knowledge and confidence. I'm super thankful for everything you did!\\

\noindent
I would like to thank my co-promoter, Danielle. It's my great honor to move to Amsterdam and join the CTG lab under your supervision. It's the best lab with amazing research outputs and nice people to work with. From you I realized the importance to do "high-impact" research. Thank you for giving me all of the great advice on my works.\\

\noindent
I would like to thank my promoter when I stayed in UMC Utrecht, Prof. Kahn. Thank you for supervising me in the first two years of my doctoral study and giving me all of the supports.\\

Now it's time to thank all the fantastic colleagues in the DCL and the CTG lab. For me, you're not only my colleagues and friends, but also my family in the Netherlands. Lianne, thank you for your help in most of my projects. In my mind you're a scientist, an artist, and a gardener. Your plants and brain arts "saved" my life and gave me inspirations. Thank you so much! Siemon, many thanks for all of your helps in my projects. Also, many thanks for all of the funny stories you told during lunch and all of the "Dutch culture" you taught me. Sorry for the snoring, my roommate! Elise, thank you for teaching me all of the knowledge about baby and fetal brain. It's so nice to work with you and to have you as a good friend. Best wishes to you and Juliette! Rory, I'm very glad to have you as my office mate. Thanks for taking the great responsibility to be my paranymph. Thank you for making tricks on me, telling me cycling with crossed hands, teaching me those "useful" Dutch words... Dirk Jan, thank you for your help in my works, especially for proof-reading my manuscripts. More importantly, thank you for teaching me ice-skating and "zwembroek"! 

Elleke, 


Xiao, thank you for your company in Utrecht. You helped me so much to adapt my daily life in the Netherlands. To be honest, having you in the lab made feel more comfortable and safer. Let's keep in touch and wish you success! Alessandra, it's my great pleasure to meet you in the Netherlands. You're always so nice to talk to and to give me a hand. Thank you for every moment with you! I'm sure we will have chances to share more delicious food!
